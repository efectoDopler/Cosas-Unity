In this game, you are a fast driver and must dodge all the trucks you find on the road if you want live.

When you start the game you have two minutes to drive.
Hitting a truck means losing 15 seconds of driving, while getting coin adds 10 seconds to the clock.

To dodge the obstacles you must move towards the left or the right of the screen. I know that some parts of the road are not very
well connected. This prototype's purpose is to learn how to use the differents element of Unity.

Â¡Enjoy with my mini game!
